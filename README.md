# Influenza
This project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I analyzed Influenza deaths and Population data across the United States to determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
# Objective 
I am an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
