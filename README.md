# Influenza
This project was part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course in which I analyzed Influenza deaths and Population data across the United States to determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.
# Objective 
Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States. Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal, does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state? Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-, medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count. Assess data limitations that may prevent me from conducting my desired analyses.
